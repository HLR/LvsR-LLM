# Figure Generation

This repository contains the code required to generate the figures presented in our research paper.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following:

1. Evaluation results of the Large Language Models (LLMs), generated by running `test.py`.
2. Evaluation results of the datasets (refer to the instructions in the `Datasets` folder).

## Usage

1. Launch the Jupyter notebook.
2. Set the `FIGURE` variable to the desired figure number (0-5).
3. Adjust other parameters as needed, such as `METRIC` and `DPI`.
4. Execute the script.

## Configuration

The following variables can be configured in the script:

| Variable | Description                                         |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `EVALUATION_RESULTS` | Path to the main evaluation results CSV file        |
| `ADMISSION_CHANCE_RESULTS` | Path to Admission Chance dataset results            |
| `INSURANCE_COST_RESULTS` | Path to Insurance Cost dataset results              |
| `USED_CAR_PRICES_RESULTS` | Path to Used Car Prices dataset results             |
| `METRIC` | Evaluation metric to use (e.g., "MSE", "MAE", "R2") |
| `DPI` | Resolution of the output figures                    |
| `FIGURE` | Figure number to generate (0-5)                     |
