"Based on the given information, a city fuel economy of 54.0 is exceptionally high and typically associated with hybrid or electric vehicles, which are more common in Toyota's lineup. Given that Maserati is known for luxury sports cars that generally have lower fuel efficiency, it is more likely that the car in question is a Toyota. Therefore, considering the average price of a used Toyota in 2019, my final estimation is $18,000."

"Based on the given information, a city fuel economy of 54.0 is exceptionally high and typically associated with hybrid or electric vehicles, which are more common in Toyota's lineup. Given this, and considering that Maserati is a luxury brand with generally higher prices, I would estimate the price of a used car in 2019 to be on the lower end of the spectrum. Therefore, my final estimation is $28000."
