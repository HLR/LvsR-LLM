"Given that the individual is a smoker, we can expect their annual medical costs to be higher than the average due to the increased health risks associated with smoking. The additional costs can be attributed to a higher likelihood of developing smoking-related illnesses such as lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory issues, which require more frequent medical attention and treatment.

Considering the impact of smoking on health and the associated medical costs, I would estimate that the annual individual medical costs for a smoker in the USA could be significantly higher than the average. Therefore, my final estimation is $20,000."
"Based on the information provided, we know that the average annual individual medical costs billed by health insurance in the USA is $13,270.42, with a standard deviation of $12,110.01. Since the individual being referred to is a non-smoker, we can assume that their medical costs may be lower than average due to the reduced health risks associated with smoking. However, without specific data on how much lower the costs for non-smokers are compared to smokers, it is challenging to make an accurate estimation. 

Considering that being a non-smoker generally leads to lower healthcare costs, I would estimate that the annual individual medical costs for a non-smoker in the USA could be around 10-20% lower than the average cost for all individuals. Therefore, my final estimation for the annual individual medical costs billed by health insurance in the USA for a non-smoker would be around $10,000 to $11,500."
"Based on the information provided, we know that the average annual individual medical costs billed by health insurance in the USA is $13,270.42, with a standard deviation of $12,110.01. Since the individual is a non-smoker, we can assume that their medical costs may be lower than average due to the reduced health risks associated with smoking. However, without specific data on how smoking status affects individual medical costs in the USA, it is challenging to provide an accurate adjustment.

Considering that smoking is a significant risk factor for various health conditions and can lead to higher medical expenses in the long run, it is reasonable to assume that non-smokers generally incur lower medical costs compared to smokers. Therefore, we can estimate that the annual individual medical costs for a non-smoker may be slightly below the average of $13,270.42.

My final estimation is $12,500."
