"Based on the given information, the annual individual medical costs billed by health insurance in the USA can vary significantly based on factors such as smoking status and BMI. Smoking and higher BMI are generally associated with increased healthcare costs due to a higher risk of various health conditions. Therefore, individuals with a lower BMI and who do not smoke are likely to have lower annual medical costs compared to those with higher BMI and who smoke.

My final estimation is 1500."
