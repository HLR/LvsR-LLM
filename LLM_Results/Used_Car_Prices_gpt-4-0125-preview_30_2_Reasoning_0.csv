"Given the parameters of city fuel economy and mileage, and considering the vast difference in brand value, performance, luxury, and pricing between Toyota and Maserati, estimating a price for a used car from either brand in 2019 without more specific information about the model, condition, or additional features is challenging. However, a city fuel economy of 14.0 MPG suggests a vehicle with a larger engine, possibly a high-performance or luxury model, which could align more closely with Maserati's offerings or a high-end Toyota model. Assuming the car is a newer model given the mileage is listed as 0.0, which indicates it could be nearly new or lightly used, the price would be on the higher end. Considering these factors, a rough estimate for such a vehicle could lean towards the lower end of a luxury car's pricing spectrum due to the lack of additional details. My final estimation is $75000."

"Given the parameters of city fuel economy at 18.0 and a mileage of 0.0, and considering the car could be either a Toyota or a Maserati from 2019, we have to account for a broad spectrum of possibilities. A brand-new or nearly new Maserati would be priced significantly higher than a Toyota due to brand prestige, performance, and luxury features. However, a Toyota with these specifications could be a higher-end model or trim. Given the mileage is 0.0, suggesting a new or nearly new condition, and balancing between the potential high value of a Maserati and the more moderate pricing of a Toyota, a middle ground estimation would be necessary. 

Considering all these factors, a reasonable estimate for a vehicle with these specifications, balancing between the potential costs of a high-end Toyota and a base model Maserati, would be around $60,000. This estimate tries to account for the wide range of possibilities given the information. My final estimation is $60,000."

"To estimate the price of a used car that can be either a Toyota or a Maserati in 2019, considering a city fuel economy of 13.0 and very low mileage of 64.0, we need to consider the brand's value, the vehicle's condition, and its luxury status. A city fuel economy of 13.0 mpg is more typical of high-performance or luxury vehicles, which often have lower fuel efficiency due to their powerful engines. Given the extremely low mileage, this suggests the car is nearly new. 

Maseratis are luxury vehicles and, even used, can command high prices, especially with such low mileage, indicating minimal use. Toyotas, while reliable and holding their value well, are generally more affordable than Maseratis. However, given the specifics (very low mileage and lower fuel economy), this car leans towards being a luxury model, possibly a Maserati or a high-end Toyota model.

Considering the luxury market and the almost new condition of the car, but also taking into account the depreciation that occurs once a new car is purchased, a reasonable estimate for a high-end vehicle from these brands with such characteristics in 2019 could be significantly high. However, without knowing the exact model, it's challenging to pinpoint an exact price. 

Given these factors, a balanced estimation considering it could be a high-end Toyota or a Maserati, leaning more towards the luxury end due to the specifics provided, would be higher than average. My final estimation is $85000."

"Given the parameters of city fuel economy at 17.0 and a mileage of 0.0, and considering the car could be either a Toyota or a Maserati from 2019, we need to account for the significant price difference between brands and the impact of a vehicle being essentially new (0.0 mileage). Maseratis, being luxury vehicles, start at a much higher base price compared to Toyotas. However, without specific model information, we must consider a broad estimation that could fit high-end Toyotas or entry-level Maseratis. 

Given these considerations, a brand-new or nearly new condition vehicle from 2019 could significantly vary in price. A high-end Toyota could be priced similarly to an entry-level Maserati, especially with no mileage. Considering the luxury status of Maserati, even at entry-level, and the premium models of Toyota, the price could be on the higher end but not as high as a new Maserati.

"Based on the city fuel economy of 14.0, which is relatively low, this suggests that the vehicle could be a larger or more performance-oriented model, potentially leaning towards a Maserati rather than a typical Toyota. Given the extremely low mileage of 10.0, this indicates that the car is nearly new. Maseratis are luxury vehicles and their prices don't depreciate as quickly as more common brands within the first few miles. However, since it's a 2019 model and considering a bit of depreciation from its original MSRP, which for a Maserati could easily start above $100,000, a fair estimation while still considering it as ""used"" could be slightly lower than its brand-new counterpart. My final estimation is $85000."

"Based on the provided city fuel economy of 14.0, which is relatively low, suggesting a vehicle with higher performance or larger size, and an extremely low mileage of 10.0 miles, indicating that the car is almost new, the vehicle in question could be a high-end model or a luxury vehicle. Given the choice between Toyota and Maserati for the year 2019, and considering the specifics, it's more likely to lean towards a Maserati or a high-end Toyota model. Maseratis are luxury vehicles with a significant price tag, and a nearly new condition would not significantly depreciate its value. However, without knowing the exact model, it's challenging to pinpoint an exact price, but given the luxury brand and the nearly new condition, the price would be on the higher end.

Considering these factors, a used Maserati or a high-end Toyota from 2019 with almost no mileage could be valued significantly. Given the luxury status and premium features typically associated with Maserati, along with the possibility of it being a high-end Toyota model, a balanced estimation considering the brand's prestige, nearly new condition, and the vehicle's performance characteristics would be necessary. 

My final estimation is 85000.0."
"To estimate the price of a used car that can be either a Toyota or Maserati in 2019 with a city fuel economy of 13.0 and mileage of 45.0, we need to consider the characteristics of both brands. Toyota vehicles are generally more affordable, have better fuel economy, and are known for reliability. Maserati, on the other hand, is a luxury brand with vehicles that are significantly more expensive, have lower fuel economy, and are focused on performance and luxury.

Given the low fuel economy of 13.0, this is more indicative of a high-performance vehicle, which aligns more with Maserati's characteristics. The extremely low mileage suggests the car is almost new. Maseratis depreciate but not as rapidly within the first few miles. Considering the car's likely high initial price and the fact that it's almost new, the price would still be quite high.

However, without specific model information, it's challenging to pinpoint an exact price. Maserati models vary widely in price, but given the almost new condition, even a used model from 2019 could be priced similarly to a new model, albeit slightly lower due to it being used.

Considering these factors, a rough estimate for a nearly new Maserati with these specifications in 2019 could be around $100,000. This accounts for the luxury brand, performance specifications indicated by the low fuel economy, and the very low mileage, which suggests the car has barely been driven. My final estimation is $100,000."

Given the choice between Toyota and Maserati for the year 2019, and considering the characteristics, it's more likely to lean towards a Maserati or a high-end Toyota model. Maseratis are luxury vehicles with a significant price tag, especially with such low mileage, but high-end Toyota models like the Land Cruiser can also be quite expensive. However, the Maserati would generally be more expensive due to its luxury status and performance specifications.

Given these considerations, the price for a nearly new Maserati or a high-end Toyota with such specifications in 2019 would be on the higher side. However, without knowing the exact model, it's challenging to pinpoint an exact price. A nearly new Maserati could easily be priced well above $70,000, depending on the model and specifications. A high-end, nearly new Toyota model could also command a high price, but typically less than a Maserati. Balancing these factors, a reasonable estimate, leaning towards the luxury segment and considering the car's almost new condition, would be higher than average for both brands.

My final estimation is $85000."

"Given the high city fuel economy of 41.0, it's likely that this vehicle is a highly efficient model, possibly a hybrid, and considering the brand possibilities of Toyota or Maserati, it's more likely to be a Toyota, as Maserati does not produce vehicles with such high fuel efficiency. The mileage of 36,856 is relatively low for a used car, suggesting it's still in good condition, which would help maintain its value. However, the specific model, its demand, and the overall condition of the car are unknown, which are significant factors in determining its price. Based on these considerations and the current market trends for used hybrid vehicles from Toyota, a reasonable estimation for the price of this used car in 2019 could be around $20,000. This takes into account the depreciation of the vehicle over time, the high fuel economy, and the relatively low mileage, which are all appealing factors for a used car buyer looking for a Toyota.

My final estimation is $20,000."

"To estimate the price of a used car that can be either a Toyota or Maserati in 2019, considering a city fuel economy of 23.0 and a low mileage of 1,782, we need to factor in the brand's average depreciation rates, the specific model's demand, and the impact of such low mileage on its valuation. Given the high fuel economy, it's likely a more efficient model, which could be a higher-end Toyota hybrid or a smaller Maserati model. The very low mileage suggests the car is nearly new, which would keep its value high. However, without knowing the exact model, it's challenging to pinpoint an exact price. Maseratis tend to depreciate faster than Toyotas but start at a much higher price point. Assuming it's a higher-end Toyota or a lower-end Maserati in excellent condition, a balanced estimation would lean towards the luxury pricing but not at the top end due to the Toyota possibility. My final estimation is $34000."

"I'm unable to provide real-time or the most current data, including prices for used cars. However, I can offer a method to estimate the price based on the information given and typical market values as of my last update.

Given the city fuel economy of 17.0, this suggests a vehicle that is likely not very fuel-efficient, which could indicate a larger vehicle or a luxury performance vehicle, such as some models from Toyota's larger SUVs or a Maserati. The extremely low mileage of 10 suggests that the car is almost new.

Considering the brand difference, a nearly new Toyota with such specifications might be priced in the upper range for Toyotas but significantly lower than a Maserati. A nearly new Maserati, on the other hand, would be priced much higher due to the brand's luxury status and performance specifications.

Given these considerations and the variance in pricing between a high-end Toyota and a Maserati, plus the fact that the car is almost new, a middle ground estimate considering both possibilities could be around $60,000. This accounts for the possibility of it being a higher-end Toyota model or a lower-end Maserati model, both with very low mileage.

My final estimation is $60,000."
"Given the parameters of city fuel economy at 16.0 MPG and a mileage of 0.0, indicating a potentially new or nearly new vehicle from 2019, and considering the vast difference in brand value and pricing between Toyota and Maserati, a precise estimate is challenging without knowing the model. However, assuming a high-end Toyota or a base model Maserati and considering the vehicle's newness, a middle ground estimate would be reasonable. Maseratis are luxury vehicles with prices that can easily exceed $100,000 when new, while high-end Toyotas can reach up to around $50,000. Given these factors, a balanced estimate, leaning towards the lower end of a Maserati's price range or a very high-end Toyota, would be appropriate. My final estimation is $70,000."

However, the nearly new condition of the car suggests it could be a premium model from either brand. Given these factors, a Maserati, even with minimal mileage, would be priced significantly higher than a Toyota. Yet, a nearly new Toyota in a high-specification could also command a premium price.

"To estimate the price of a used car that can be either a Toyota or Maserati in 2019, considering a city fuel economy of 13.0 and very low mileage of 38.0, we need to consider the brand and model implications. A city fuel economy of 13.0 mpg is more indicative of a high-performance vehicle, which leans more towards a Maserati than a typical Toyota. Given the extremely low mileage, this suggests the car is nearly new.

Maseratis are luxury vehicles with high depreciation rates, but with such low mileage, the depreciation would not be as significant as for a vehicle with average mileage. The price for a nearly new Maserati, depending on the model, could be quite high. However, without knowing the specific model, it's challenging to pinpoint an exact price. Given the luxury market segment and assuming it's a more accessible Maserati model with minimal depreciation due to the low mileage, the price could be on the higher end.

Maseratis are luxury vehicles and have a significantly higher price point compared to Toyotas. Given the extremely low mileage, this suggests the car is almost new. Maseratis depreciate quickly, but with such low mileage, the depreciation wouldn't be as severe. A new Maserati could range well into the six figures, while a high-end Toyota would be significantly less. Considering these factors and without specific model information, a rough estimate would lean towards the higher end due to the luxury association with Maserati and the practically new condition of the car.

"To estimate the price of a used car that can be either a Toyota or Maserati in 2019 with a city fuel economy of 19.0 and mileage of 0.0, we need to consider the brand and model implications. A city fuel economy of 19.0 mpg suggests it could be a performance-oriented model or a larger vehicle, which could fit profiles of both Toyota and Maserati vehicles. However, the price difference between brands is significant, with Maserati being a luxury brand and Toyota being more mainstream.

Given the mileage is 0.0, this indicates the car is practically new, which would keep its price closer to the original MSRP. For a Toyota, this could mean a high-end SUV or a performance model like the Supra, which would be priced high for a Toyota but not nearly as high as a Maserati. A new Maserati, on the other hand, would start at a much higher base price due to its luxury status.

Considering these factors and without specific model information, we must average out the potential high end of Toyota and the lower end of Maserati's pricing spectrum. Given the new condition (0.0 mileage), a Toyota could be in the upper $40,000s to $50,000s, while a Maserati would likely be over $100,000. Averaging these with a lean towards the luxury pricing due to the 0.0 mileage indicating a very recent model year or unused status, a reasonable estimate might be in the lower range of luxury car pricing.

"Given the parameters of city fuel economy at 16.0 MPG and a mileage of 0.0, indicating a nearly new or very lightly used vehicle, and considering the vehicle could be either a Toyota or a Maserati, the price estimation requires balancing the wide price range between these brands. Toyota vehicles, known for their reliability and affordability, span a broad price range but are generally much less expensive than Maseratis, which are luxury sports cars. A nearly new or very lightly used Maserati, especially a 2019 model, would be priced significantly higher due to its luxury status, performance capabilities, and brand prestige. On the other hand, a Toyota, even with high-end specifications, would be substantially less expensive. 

Given the fuel economy is relatively low at 16.0 MPG, which is more typical of higher performance or larger vehicles, this might hint at a more expensive model from either brand, possibly a high-end Toyota SUV or a Maserati. Considering the vehicle's condition as nearly new or very lightly used, and balancing the potential for it to be either brand, a middle ground estimation, leaning towards the higher end due to the Maserati possibility but not reaching the top prices seen for new Maseratis, would be appropriate.

The choice between Toyota and Maserati significantly impacts the price estimation due to the brands' different market positions. Toyota offers vehicles across a wide range of prices, including some high-end models, but Maserati is a luxury brand with vehicles priced much higher on average. Given the specifics, if we were to assume the vehicle could be from either brand, the low fuel economy and low mileage might suggest a high-end Toyota SUV or a Maserati. Since Maseratis are luxury cars and the vehicle is almost new, the price would be on the higher end but not as high as a brand new Maserati due to immediate depreciation once a new car is purchased.

"Given the city fuel economy of 16.0 and a mileage of 0.0, which suggests a new or nearly new condition, and considering the significant price difference between brands like Toyota and Maserati, the estimation must account for the possibility of it being a high-end Toyota or a base model Maserati. Newer vehicles with zero mileage are priced closer to their original MSRP, but the specific model, brand, and luxury level significantly affect the price. A Maserati, even at a base model, would be priced much higher than most Toyotas due to its luxury status. However, a high-end Toyota model with premium features could also command a higher price. Given these factors, a balanced estimation considering it could be either a Toyota or Maserati, leaning towards the lower end of luxury vehicle pricing due to the broader market appeal and higher sales volumes of Toyotas, would be reasonable. My final estimation is $55,000."

"Given the parameters of city fuel economy at 14.0, which suggests a vehicle with lower fuel efficiency typically associated with high-performance or luxury vehicles, and a mileage of 0.0 indicating a new or nearly new condition, the estimation process leans towards a higher value. The brand potential varies significantly between Toyota and Maserati, with Maserati being a luxury brand that commands a higher price point. Considering a 2019 model year, the vehicle in question could be a high-end Toyota model or a base to mid-range Maserati. Given these factors, the price for a vehicle with these specifications could be quite high, but without specific model information, a precise figure is challenging to pinpoint. However, assuming it leans more towards a luxury or high-performance model given the fuel economy and brand possibilities, a reasonable estimate would place it in the upper price range for consumer vehicles. My final estimation is 75000."

"To estimate the price of a used car that can be either a Toyota or a Maserati in 2019 with a city fuel economy of 17.0 and mileage of 0.0, we need to consider the significant price difference between the brands. Toyota vehicles are generally more affordable, while Maseratis are luxury cars with a much higher price tag. A brand new or nearly new Maserati or a high-end Toyota model with 0 mileage would be priced significantly differently. Given the luxury status of Maserati, even at the lower end of their pricing spectrum for a new or nearly new vehicle, the price would be quite high. However, without specific model information, it's challenging to pinpoint an exact price. Considering the broad spectrum of possibilities, a middle ground considering both brands could be around $70,000, leaning towards the lower end for a Maserati or a high-end Toyota model. My final estimation is $70,000."
"Based on the city fuel economy of 14.0, which is relatively low, this suggests that the vehicle in question could be a high-performance car or a larger vehicle, such as an SUV, which are categories that both Toyota and Maserati have offerings in. However, given the extremely low mileage of 10.0, this vehicle is almost new. Maserati vehicles, being luxury sports cars or SUVs, depreciate but still retain a high value if the mileage is this low, especially if it's a 2019 model. Toyota, while having some higher-end models like the Land Cruiser or the Supra, generally falls into a more affordable price range, even for vehicles with low mileage.

Considering these factors, if the vehicle is a Maserati, its price would be significantly higher due to the brand's luxury status, even with depreciation. On the other hand, a nearly new Toyota, even a higher-end model, would be less expensive than a Maserati but still priced on the higher end for the brand due to the low mileage. Given the mix of possible scenarios, a middle ground estimate that leans towards the luxury pricing of a low-mileage Maserati but also considers the possibility of a high-end Toyota model would be appropriate.

My final estimation is 85000.0."

"To estimate the price of a used car that can be either a Toyota or Maserati in 2019, considering a city fuel economy of 19.0 and mileage of 34,141, we need to balance the factors. A city fuel economy of 19.0 mpg suggests it could be a larger or more performance-oriented vehicle, which might align more with a Maserati, but the high mileage leans towards a lower price point more typical of a used Toyota. However, given the specific details, this scenario seems to lean towards a higher-end Toyota model or a lower-end Maserati model, possibly a bit older. Taking into account the depreciation of luxury vehicles like Maserati and the durability and lower depreciation rates of Toyota, a middle ground estimate would be appropriate. 

My final estimation is 25505.0."

"Given the city fuel economy of 16.0, which is relatively low, suggesting a vehicle with a larger engine or a performance-oriented model, and the extremely low mileage of 20.0, indicating that the car is nearly new, we're likely looking at a high-value vehicle. The choice between Toyota and Maserati significantly impacts the price, with Maserati being a luxury brand and Toyota offering a range of more affordable options. However, given the specifics, it's plausible this could be a high-end Toyota model or a base model Maserati. Considering the near-new condition but acknowledging the broad price range between the brands, a balanced estimate would lean towards the lower end of luxury pricing. My final estimation is $75000."

"Given the city fuel economy of 17.0, which suggests a vehicle with lower fuel efficiency, possibly indicating a larger or more performance-oriented vehicle, and considering the mileage of 38,591, which is moderate, indicating some use but not excessive for a 2019 model year, the price estimation needs to balance these factors. 

For a Toyota, this could be indicative of a larger SUV or a truck, which tend to hold their value well, but for a Maserati, which depreciates faster but starts at a much higher price point, the valuation would be significantly impacted by the brand's luxury status and higher initial cost. 

Given these considerations, a used Toyota in this condition might be priced in the mid to high range for used vehicles of its type, while a Maserati, even with depreciation, would still command a higher price due to its luxury branding. 

Balancing these factors, and considering the broad spectrum between Toyota and Maserati, a middle-ground estimate that leans towards the higher end due to the low mileage and the potential for the car to be a luxury model would be reasonable. 

My final estimation is $47,500."

"To estimate the price of a used car that can be either a Toyota or a Maserati in 2019, considering a city fuel economy of 14.0 and a very low mileage of 10.0, we need to consider the brand's market positioning. Toyota vehicles, known for their reliability and affordability, would not typically have such a low fuel economy unless it's a larger vehicle or performance model. On the other hand, Maserati, being a luxury and performance brand, fits the profile for a vehicle with this fuel economy more closely, especially with such low mileage, indicating a nearly new state.

Given the luxury status of Maserati, even a slightly used model from 2019 would retain a significant portion of its value, especially with mileage as low as 10.0, suggesting it's almost new. However, without specific model information, it's challenging to pinpoint an exact price, but it would be significantly higher than any Toyota model with similar specifications.

Considering the factors above, the price for a nearly new, low-mileage Maserati from 2019 would be on the higher end of the spectrum. My final estimation is $85000."

"To estimate the price of a used car that can be either a Toyota or Maserati in 2019 with a city fuel economy of 13.0 and mileage of 35.0, we need to consider the significant factors affecting the price. The city fuel economy suggests a vehicle with higher fuel consumption, typically associated with high-performance or luxury vehicles, which could indicate a Maserati. The extremely low mileage indicates that the car is almost new. Maseratis are luxury vehicles, and their prices do not depreciate as quickly as more common brands within the first few years. Given these factors, the price would be on the higher end. However, without specific model information, providing an exact number is challenging. Considering the luxury brand, almost new condition, and assuming it's a recent model, a rough estimate would be significantly higher than an average vehicle. My final estimation is 85000."

"Given the parameters of city fuel economy at 15.0 and a mileage of 0.0, and considering the car could be either a Toyota or a Maserati in 2019, we have to account for a wide range of possibilities. A brand new or nearly new Maserati, known for its luxury and performance, would be priced significantly higher than most Toyotas, which are generally more affordable and cater to a different market segment. However, since the mileage is 0.0, indicating a potentially new or unused vehicle, and the fuel economy is relatively low, which is more characteristic of high-performance or luxury vehicles like a Maserati, the price would lean towards the higher end of the spectrum. 

Considering these factors, the price of such a vehicle in 2019 could be significantly varied based on the make and model. A new Toyota with these specifications could be a high-end model, but still would not reach the price levels of a Maserati. A Maserati, on the other hand, especially a model with a city fuel economy of 15.0, would be priced much higher, reflecting its luxury status and performance capabilities. 

Given the luxury branding of Maserati, even with the potential for it being a Toyota, the presence of a 0.0 mileage suggests a new or nearly new condition, which would elevate the price. Therefore, a balanced estimation considering both possibilities but leaning towards the higher end due to the specifications and condition would be necessary. 

My final estimation is $85000."

"I'm unable to provide real-time or the most current data, including prices for specific items such as cars. However, I can offer a method to estimate the price based on the information given.

Given the city fuel economy is 15.0, which is relatively low, this suggests the vehicle could be a larger or more performance-oriented model, which might align more with a Maserati than a typical Toyota. The extremely low mileage of 122 suggests the car is almost new. Maseratis are luxury vehicles and their prices can be significantly higher than Toyotas, even when used. However, without knowing the exact model, year (beyond being a 2019 model), and other factors like condition, location, and market trends at the time of sale, it's challenging to pinpoint an exact price.

Considering the vehicle is a 2019 model with very low mileage and assuming it leans towards the luxury end (potentially a Maserati given the fuel economy and the luxury context implied), the price would be expected to be on the higher side. However, since it's a used vehicle, there would be some depreciation from its original MSRP.

Based on these considerations and the luxury market segment, a rough estimation for a vehicle like this could be in the higher end of the used car market. My final estimation is $85000."

"Given the parameters of city fuel economy and very low mileage, and considering the vast difference in brand value and market positioning between Toyota and Maserati, a precise estimate is challenging without knowing the specific model. However, a city fuel economy of 16.0 MPG is more indicative of a performance-oriented vehicle, which could align more with a Maserati's characteristics than a typical Toyota. Assuming the car is a recent model year (2019) and factoring in the extremely low mileage, which suggests almost new condition, the price would likely be on the higher end of the spectrum, especially if it's a Maserati. Yet, without specific model information, a balanced estimate considering both brands could be around $70,000, acknowledging the higher value and pricing of Maseratis over Toyotas, and the fact that the car is almost unused. My final estimation is $70,000."

"Given the parameters of city fuel economy at 15.0, which suggests a vehicle with lower fuel efficiency typically associated with larger or more performance-oriented vehicles, and a mileage of 0.0, indicating a new or nearly new condition, the estimation process for a used car that could be either a Toyota or a Maserati in 2019 involves considering the brand's market positioning and vehicle type. Toyota, known for reliability and affordability, offers a range of vehicles including some performance models, but none that would typically have such low fuel economy except for larger SUVs or trucks. Maserati, on the other hand, is a luxury brand known for high-performance sports cars and luxury sedans, which are more likely to have lower fuel efficiency.

Given the vehicle's nearly new condition and assuming it's a model from either brand that would justify such fuel economy figures, it's more likely to be a higher-end Toyota model or a base to mid-range Maserati. The price for a nearly new Maserati in 2019 could easily exceed $70,000, while a high-end Toyota, such as a Land Cruiser, could be in the $60,000 to $85,000 range depending on the specifications and model year.

Considering these factors and aiming for a single estimate that could feasibly apply to either a high-end Toyota or a more average Maserati, balancing between the two brands' market positions and the specifics provided, a reasonable estimate for the price of such a vehicle in 2019, taking into account depreciation for being ""used"" even with zero mileage, would be slightly lower than the new price but still significant due to the implied luxury or performance orientation.

My final estimation is $65000."

"Given the city fuel economy of 16.0, which is relatively low, suggesting a vehicle with higher performance or larger size, and the extremely low mileage of 32.0, indicating almost no use, the car in question could be a high-end model from either Toyota or Maserati. Maseratis are luxury vehicles with a price tag significantly higher than most Toyotas, but high-end Toyota models, especially those under the Lexus brand (Toyota's luxury division), can also command a premium price. Considering the 2019 model year, which is relatively recent, and assuming the car is in nearly new condition given the mileage, the price could be on the higher end for both brands. However, without knowing the specific model, it's challenging to pinpoint an exact price. Averaging the potential high-end Toyota and a lower-end Maserati, and considering depreciation, my final estimation is $77000."
